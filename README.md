# Simple-search
Create your own search engine! It probably wonâ€™t compete with Google: 
yours will be a simple version which processes some data and searches it for a word or a phrase. Simple but cool.

stage1:
Write a small program that reads a single line and then another line. The word to search for is in the first line. 
The program should output the index of this word in the first line. 
If there is no such word in the first line, the program should print "Not Found". Please remember that indexes start from 1!
